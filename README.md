## Rust-Basics !
Learn the basics of Rust programming language as one of the alternatives of C++.

## How to write Rust ?
You can use any editor for writing <b>Rust</b> programs.<br>

I would prefer you to use : <i>Visual Studio Code (Linux, Mac, Windows), Geany, and Nano (Linux)</i>


## How to compile Rust ?

To compile, use the following command

<b>rustc</b> is a compiler while "main.rs" is the name of file. <br>

Here <b>.rs</b> is the file extension of Rust.

```bash

```
After the compilation, it will produce the executable file.
